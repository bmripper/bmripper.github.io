# Business Intelligence Portfolio

The first project to discuss is my work in Artifical Intelligence (AI), specially Reinforcement Learning. I am attempting to create a control system 
for distributed energy resources (DERs) using AI. The first project was my initial attempt at a simple model: learn the optimal operating procedue for
a given solar/natural gas turbine, given multiple parameters. I created a simulator in Excel, to confirm the simulation idea worked. Then, I created a
Python script that will use reinforcement learning to find the optimal path.
