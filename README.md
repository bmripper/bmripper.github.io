## Automation Utilities

- Export your Vanguard Personal Investor "Performance Details" table directly to CSV using the Playwright-based helper in `scripts/vanguard_performance_export.py`. Install dependencies with `pip install pandas playwright` and run `playwright install chromium` once before the first run. Launch the scraper via `python scripts/vanguard_performance_export.py --help` for usage instructions and options. Flags such as `--store-html-debug` and `--pause-on-error` can aid troubleshooting if Vanguard changes the page layout or multi-factor prompts appear.
