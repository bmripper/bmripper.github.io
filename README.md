### Etiquette
This is the shared repository for Bilfinger's Data Analytics Department's extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) files related to Bilfinger Connect Asset Performance (BCAP) 
- Please host all ETL files related to BCAP dashboards here (e.g., Power BI files, Python/R scripts, etc). 
- Please provide clear comments and documentation when checking-in/out files. 
- Please use appropriate file and folder structure processes, if unclear reach out to: brent.ripperger@bilfinger.com
- Before checking-in files, please confirm the DevOps move from Development to Production was successful. If it wasn't, please do not check-in the file. 

### Terminology
- If you check-out a file, that file is in Development
- If you are ready to check-in a file, that file is in Quality
- If you checked-in a file, that file is in Production
- Every file from this GitHub repository should be the most recent version in our Production version of BCAP
