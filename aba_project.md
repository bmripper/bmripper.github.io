# Advanced Business Analytics

The project demonstrates my work in advanced business analytics, specially applying statistics and distribution models to business data. In this project, I show how one can use distribution formluas to "fill-in" data gaps due to only having collected limited data. In order to do this, we first determine a theoretical/reasonable data distribution using domain knowledge. For example, for filling in height data one would assume a normal distribution. Another example, for counting the number of hurricanes in Florida one would assume a Poisson distribution. Once we determine the theoretical model, we learn the constants that minimize probability error [MLE](https://towardsdatascience.com/probability-concepts-explained-maximum-likelihood-estimation-c7b4342fdbb1). We then get a continuous data distribution that we can use to predict likely outcomes from unseen data.
